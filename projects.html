                    <h2>Predictive health diagnostic and management system</h2>
                    <p>Aajoh was a digital health start-up company that used AI to provide e-health services in Nigeria. Aajoh's mission was to improve the quality of healthcare in Nigeria, by using technology to provide access to affordable and accurate
                        diagnostic services. To achieve this, the company offered a range of health services, including e-consultations, e-prescriptions, and e-lab test services. Founding members of Witeroo Inc. were involved in the company’s flagship
                        product, an AI-powered platform that helped patients book appointments, track their medical history, and receive diagnosis and treatment recommendations from doctors. Aajoh has been featured in several publications and online articles,
                        including Ventureburn, Princeton University’s Journal of public and international affairs and Disrupt Africa. Aajoh changed the way people thought about health in Africa and made a positive impact on the lives of its users.

                    <h2>Resistance/projection fastener welding project solutions</h2>
                    <p>As part of a larger engineering and controls team, Witeroo Inc individuals have been involved in the controls integration, software and application programming of resistance and projection welding solutions commonly used in the automotive
                        industry for joining stamped parts together. These parts such as stampings and sheet metal assemblies often require fastening solutions that are resistant to both the elements and the wear-and-tear of daily use, hence the use of
                        resistance or projection welding for manufacturing in automotive plants. The welding solutions we were involved in were compact and easy to use, offering unique features like automatic weld sequence generation and offline programming,
                        which helped improve productivity and efficiency. They were also modular, with ease of expansion and upgrade, able to weld a wide range of materials and flexible to accommodate changes in production requirements.

                    <p>The 10R60 and 10R80 input transmission shaft is a joint venture program between Ford and GM with inputs from tier 1 automotive suppliers for Ford and GM’s 10-speed transmission. The goal of the program was to develop an input shaft
                        for a new generation of transmissions that were both more durable and easier to manufacture than the current design. The new input shaft was made from a high-strength steel alloy and was significantly lighter than previous input
                        shafts. One of Witeroo Inc members was part of the program team involved in the industrial automation software integration, programming and engineering stages of the program. State-of-the-art automation and robotics were used to
                        produce the input shafts giving them superior quality and efficiency. Applications of the 10R60 shaft can be found in Ford Explorer and Ford Bronco while 10R80 transmissions in F-150, Ford Mustang, and Ranger to mention a few.

                    <p>GM's T1-XX program was created to advance the state of the art in body welding for their Oshawa Chevrolet truck manufacturing facility. The program consisted of two parts: constructing a new body shop at GM's Oshawa facility and the
                        developing new techniques and equipment for body welding. The new body shop was built using the latest methods, standards and materials, and featured advanced welding systems from industry-leading industrial automation integrators
                        and solution providers. This made it possible to weld GM's truck bodies with significantly greater accuracy and speed than before. Witeroo Inc’s direct involvement in the program from the controls engineering and industrial automation
                        standpoint included controls software programming, user/systems acceptance testing, systems performance verification checklists and production support. The body welding program is highly sophisticated, involving advanced engineering
                        controls, software, manufacturing and robotics processes in other to weld the body of a Chevrolet truck. The GM T1-XX Body Welding Program is one of the most advanced welding programs in the world, and it has helped to put Oshawa
                        on the map as a world-class manufacturing center.

                    <p>The first version of Witeroo Inc web-application was created with the intent of creating an online presence for the business. Prior to the application creation the company had been in operation, involved in programs and projects as
                        a sub-contractor and consultant in the industrial automation industry. As a result of these, the need arose for a digital face for the business to highlight what we do and provide access to company feedback. Version 1 of the web
                        application was hosted on AWS cloud, deployed using platform-as-a-service resource, elasticbeanstalk for quick and easy maintenance, monitoring and configuration. To ensure optimal application functionality without any reduced
                        performance from the user standpoint, the environment configuration included automatic scaling to increase and decrease the number of instances using scaling criteria based on instance activity metrics. The objectives of the v1
                        application project were met from the presence it created and the number of feedbacks obtained from the feedback section.

                        to the world. Powered by AWS cloud services, the application was built with scalability, maintainability and agility in mind, having loosely coupled services for ease of future updates and changes. In a bid to increase activity
                        with the application, content management, subscription management and user management services were new features included in version 2. The rebranded logo and user experience interface were redesigned from scratch giving the application
                        as a whole an original feel. Due to the overall and complete changes needed from v1 to v2, the entire and individual process and services went through the phases of software development lifecycle from planning to implementation.
