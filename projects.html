                        <p>Aajoh was a digital health start-up company that used AI to provide e-health services in Nigeria. Aajoh’s mission was to improve the quality of healthcare by using technology to provide access to affordable and accurate diagnostic
                            services. Founding members of Witeroo Inc. were involved in the company’s flagship product, an AI-powered platform patient used to book appointments, track medical history, and receive diagnosis and treatment recommendations
                            from doctors. Featured in publications and online articles, including Ventureburn, Princeton University’s Journal of public and international affairs and Disrupt Africa, Aajoh changed the way people thought about health in
                            Africa and made a positive impact on the lives of its users.

                        <p>As part of a larger engineering team, Witeroo Inc individuals were involved in the controls integration, software and application programming of resistance and projection welding solutions commonly used in the automotive industry
                            for joining of stamped parts. These parts such as sheet metal assemblies often require fastening solutions that are resistant to both the elements and the wear-and-tear of daily use, hence the use of resistance or projection
                            welding applications in automotive plants. The solutions were compact and easy to use, offering unique features like auto weld sequence generation and offline programming, improving productivity and efficiency. They were also
                            modular, with ease of expansion and upgrade, able to weld a wide range of materials and flexible to accommodate changes in production requirements.

                        <p>The 10R60 and 10R80 input transmission shaft is a joint venture program between Ford and GM for their 10-speed transmission shaft. The goal of the program was to develop an input shaft for a new generation of transmissions that
                            were durable and easier to manufacture than the current design. The new input shaft was made from a high-strength steel alloy and was significantly lighter than previous input shafts. One of Witeroo Inc's members was part of
                            the program team during the automation engineering integration, programming and operations stages of the program featuring state-of-the-art controls and robotics used to produce the shafts with superior quality and efficiency.
                            Applications of the 10R60 shaft can be found in Ford Explorer and Ford Bronco while 10R80 transmissions in F-150, Ford Mustang, and Ranger.

                        <p>Using industry-recognized Infrastructure as Code tool Terraform, the provisioning process for your cloud resources across cloud provider platforms can be sped up, avoiding human error and ensuring that the infrastructure is consistent
                            across environments. Terraform’s broad adoption in the cloud computing community is due to its ease of use, strong community support, and rich set of features. The Infrastructure as Code (IaC) approach for managing infrastructure
                            is declarative, reproducible, scalable, and version-able making Terraform an efficient and cost-effective tool for resource automation for your organization, eliminating the need for individual or manual effort. Infrastructure
                            automation will ensure organizational response to change and help achieve greater agility and consistency.</p>

                            for body welding. The shop, built using the latest methods and standards featured advanced welding systems from leading industrial automation integrators and solution providers, making it possible to weld a GM truck body with
                            significantly greater accuracy and speed. Witeroo Inc’s direct involvement in the program included controls software design, programming, user/systems acceptance testing, build and software verification and production support.
                            The program is highly sophisticated, involving advanced engineering controls, software, manufacturing and robotics processes. GM T1-XX body welding program is one of the most advanced welding programs in the world, putting

                        <p>For organizations with several containerized applications to manage, Kubernetes is a versatile tool and the gold standard for deployment and management of containerized applications thanks to its robust features and ease of use.
                            The preference for deployment with Kubernetes over traditional deployment can be seen from its ease of deployment at scale, minimal configuration and performance in various environments. A Kubernetes cluster of nodes running
                            one or more pod(s) with one or more container(s) provides all the needed features for the application's performance including networking, storage and more. Kubernetes can be used to automate many of the tasks involved in your
                            organization's application deployment and management, making it an ideal solution for organizations that want to focus on their core business instead of infrastructure management. With Kubernetes, businesses can achieve greater
                            efficiency and flexibility in their application deployments.</p>

                            The need arose for a digital face for the business, highlighting what we do and providing access to company feedback. Version 1 of the application was hosted on AWS cloud, deployed using the platform-as-a-service resource,
                            elastic beanstalk for quick and easy maintenance, monitoring and configuration. To ensure optimal application functionality without any reduced performance from the user standpoint, the environment configuration included automatic
                            scaling to add or reduce the number of instances using scaling criteria based on instance activity metrics. The objectives of the v1 application were met from the presence it created and the number of feedbacks obtained.
